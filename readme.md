## About Keepinsport

Keepinsport was first intented as an aggregation platform to provide a single
point of entry for different sports communities. As such several "connectors" were
written and allowed to import sport activities data from a wide variety of sources.


This "KS" fork, is a complete rewrite upon Keepinsport first idea, with a strong focus
on cyclism. I intend to write a complete set of dedicated power analysis tools to
help cyclists plan their season and analyse their activities.

As for now, Ks will have a limited support of social community, but future plans could
include a community based coaching.

All contributions are welcome :)
